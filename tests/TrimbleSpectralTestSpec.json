This section gives an overview of the Trimble Ag APIs and how they are used.\n</div>\n\n  * **Definitions of {{variables}}:**  \n    **TID - Trimble Identity {{Env Auth root}}:**  \n    **Production Authentication -** https://id.trimble.com  \n    **Staging Authentication** - https://id.trimble.com  \n  \n    **{{yourAppName}}:** the application name assigned to your integration** **  \n    **{{yourClientId}}:** the GUID assigned to your integration  \n    **{{authenticationCallbackUrl}}:** the url to return to your application from oAuth login at TID (must be an exact match to a URL in the list of valid authenticationCallbackURLs you provide)  \n    **{{yourLogoutUrl}}: (optional)** the url to return to your application from logout at TID (if used must be an exact match to a URL in the list of valid logoutURLs you provide)  \n    **{{authorizationRedirectUrl}}:** The URL that users should be returned to after Authorizing organizations for data access in trimbleag.com (must be an exact match to a URL in the list of valid authorizationRedirect URLs you provide)  \n    **{{authProvider}}:** the returned value of which authentication provider was used  \n    **{{TIDAuthCode}}:** the code generated by the TID system that you can exchange for an access, refresh and id token from TID.  This code is good for 1 use and expires after 10 mins.  \n    **{{AccessToken}}:** the JWT token with a 1 hour expiration that is used to call Data endpoints  \n    **{{IdToken}}:** the JWT token with additional information about the user who was authenticated in TID  \n    **{{RefreshToken}}:** the token with a 7 day expiration that can be exchanged for a new access token  \n  \n    **Trimble Ag API {{Env Data root}}:**  \n    **Production Data** - https://cloud.api.trimble.com/Trimble-Ag-Software/externalApi  \n    **Staging Data** - https://cloud.api.trimble.com/Trimble-Ag-Software/externalApi-stg<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\">\n\n<img src=\"https://tst-agdeveloper.trimbleag.team/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2022-02-22-at-08-39-39-Trimble-Ag-API-Developer-Guide-v3.5-Transition-to-Auto-Documentation.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2485\" /> </figure> \n\nTo exchange data using the Connected Farm APIs, do the following:\n\n  * Obtain your API credentials from your Trimble contact. This will include your “ClientId, Secret and ApplicationName” to be used in the “Authentication Token API” referenced below under Authorization/Authentication.&nbsp; You will need to provide a logo to be displayed on the authorization page and a return URL for users to come back to your application after the authorization process. Logo dimensions should be 140 px by 140 px.\n  * Your customers must have a Trimble Ag account (created at [www.TrimbleAg.com][1]). Each user account will have access to one or more organizations. An organization is the basic structure that segregates user data. An organization typically represents the business entity that manages the resources (fields, equipment, personel, materials) used in a farming operation.\n  * Your users must approve your application to access their data within [www.TrimbleAg.com][1] either via an OAuth process you initiate or directly via [www.TrimbleAg.com][1]&nbsp;\n  * To allow your application to access your customer’s Connected Farm data, you must do the following:\n      * Obtain an access token&nbsp;\n      * Once the client application has an access token, you will use the the other Trimble Ag API endpoints.\n\n [1]: http://www.trimbleag.com"

It also returns an id and refresh token for identification and re-authentication after the access token expires. The authentication token is valid for 1 hour and the refresh token is valid for 9 days.

      "description": "<div class=\"overview\">\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">\n  <strong>Referencing ADAPT</strong>\n</p>\n\nYou can reference ADAPT using NuGet by referencing the package at <https://www.nuget.org/packages/AgGatewayADAPTFramework/>&nbsp; If you would rather not use a NuGet client, you can download any version of the package from nuget.org and extract it using a zip utility. In addition to executables, the ADAPT package contains a “Resources” folder that contains RepresentationSystem.xml and UnitSystem.xml. This entire Resources folder needs to be copied to your application’s \\bin directory for the representation system to work.\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">\n  <strong>Application Data Model</strong>\n</p>\n\nThe ADAPT Application Data Model is being documented by the AgGateway committee responsible forthe ADAPT project. The project homepage is found at <http://www.adaptframework.org/>\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">\n  <strong>Plugin Manager</strong>\n</p>\n\nThe Plugin Manager is used to retrieve and marshal plugins. The PluginFactory must be passed a filesystem directory where the plugin assemblies are stored. Note that while there may be subdirectories (i.e., a folder for each manufacturers’ plugins), the plugin manager will only recurse one level of subdirectories. In other words, passing “C:\\AdaptPlugins\\” to the PluginFactory would cause it to discover plugins inside both “C:\\AdaptPlugins\\” and first level subdirectories like “C:\\AdaptPlugins\\Trimble\\”, but not in “C:\\AdaptPlugins\\Trimble\\AgGPS\\”. Following is sample code which shows how to load plugins and import a datacard.\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>PluginFactory factory = new PluginFactory(\"directory containing plugins\");\nList&lt;string&gt; pluginNames = factory.AvailablePlugins;\nforeach(string pluginName in pluginNames)\n{\n  IPlugin plugin = factory.GetPlugin(pluginName);\n  if(plugin.IsDataCardSupported(\"datacard path\")\n  {\n    ApplicationDataModel dataModel = plugin.Import(\"datacard path\");\n    return dataModel;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">\n  <strong>Representation</strong>\n</p>\n\nThe Representation namespace includes two sets of helper API’s the Unit of Measure System and the Representation System. Together, they form something similar to the ISO DDI system of describing data. A Representation describes the type of data – such as harvest moisture, implement section state, or the GPS receiver offsets. A Unit of Measure provides both the syntax for specifying a unit and the ability to convert between different units of measure or perform arithmetic operations. You can explore the Representations and the units of measure in the included RepresentationSystem.xml and UnitSystem.xml files. Note that these xml files are used by the Representation namespace; if you reference the ADAPT Representation assembly, you will need to include those xml files as resources which are copied to your application’s executing directory.\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">\n  <strong>Unit of Measure System</strong>\n</p>\n\nThe simplest way to retrieve unit of measure objects is using static methods on the UnitSystemManager class. To retrieve a UnitOfMeasure instance, pass a unit code to UnitSystemManager.GetUnitOfMeasure(“unit code”). You may also use UN Rec20 unit codes, via UnitSystemManager.FromUNRec20Code(“UN unit code”).\n\nTo help use the units of measure: Once you create a NumericValue, which consists of a value and unit, we offer helper methods for arithmetic operations or unit conversions. If you add the namespace: using AgGateway.ADAPT.Representation.UnitSystem.ExtensionMethods; You will then have access to NumericalValue.Add(double value), NumericalValue.ConvertToUnit(UnitOfMeasure unit), and other helper methods."

Applications will need to be registered in the Trimble Cloud system to access this API.\n\nTo simplify the process of authenticating and requesting the token, functions have been added to the Trimble plugins that will perform the API calls for a 3rd party application to request a new token. The function is:\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>AdaptTokenClient.GetTokenAsync( {AppName}, {AppClientID}, {AppSecret} )\n</code></pre>\n\n  * AppName: Name of calling application as registered in Trimble Cloud\n  * AppClientID: GUID assigned to application by Trimble Cloud\n  * AppSecret: Application password assigned by Trimble Cloud\n\nThe token structure returned will have the following:\n\n  * token: string with encrypted token value to be used in Initialize function\n  * expiration: date and time the token expires. Tokens can be reused up to the expiration date.\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">\n  <strong>Datacard Paths</strong>\n</p>\n\nThe Trimble plugin will support multiple datacard paths. It will support a path that includes the **AgGPS** or **AgData** directory (ex: C:\\TrimbleData\\AgGPS). It will also support passing the parent directory as well (ex: C:\\TrimbleData).\n\nPlease note that the plugin will not support both file formats at once. If you have a datacard path that has both an AgGPS and AgData directory, it will only read the AgGPS information."
